# Introductory HTML and JavaScript
### Structure : 
s very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document.

Structure helps readers understand the stories. Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each story, there will be a headline, text and maybe an image this is how to structure be used to shape pages.

Like a newspaper HTML structure pages by using elements. As it uses attributes to tell us More about elements.

### Extra Markup:-
Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML. (HTML4, XHTML1.0, HTML5)

Doc Type: Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included). We will therefore be including one in each example for the rest of the book.

Comments ON HTML: !-- --

If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters.

* ID Attribute: Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). No two elements on the same page must have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).

* Class Attribute: Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that contain information that is more important than others and want to distinguish these elements, or you might want to differentiate between links that point to other pages on your site and links that point to external sites.


### HTML5 layout:-
HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

HTML5 Layout Elements
While the traditional HTML uses 'div' element to group related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer, or sidebar). HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them.
